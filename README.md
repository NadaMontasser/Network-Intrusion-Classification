# Network-Intrusion-Classification
> Cyberattacks are becoming more complex, it is getting harder to detect specific intrusions. The techniques used here for detection are based on machine learning techniques, The technique of extracting useful knowledge from huge amounts of data.

**Project steps:**
1. Data analysis and EDA 
2. Feaure Engineering
3. Modelling
4. Optimaization
